      "Many years ago, people asked \"what's the practical use of a personal computer for the average user?\", and the answer was \"there really isn't one\", because computers were slow and had limited memory. Sure, you could do your budget on a spreadsheet, but that was more of a way of showing you used a computer than being efficient. Computers were turned off regularly in those days, and the budget would be stored on cassette tape and would take some time to load. Paper budgets were more effective.\n",

So I resorted to the python docs, looking at all the basic functions and mastering every one. It took a while, but I would write a program that includes and revolves around that new thing I learned. Whenever I didn’t know of a function existed, I would just look it up on google. Typically W3Schools or something would have it. Whenever I learned a new function, I would put that code on a replit at repl.it. I would also put how to use it exactly in comments(#[your text]). So whenever I got lost, I could scroll through my replits and find one I was looking for. I then could look at how you use it, and then I would include it in my program.

      "\n",
      "For self, think of it as a universal variable for your class(Might make it harder to understand, but a variable for your class specific to the object your using it with).

But I needed to remind myself time is a commodity, so sometimes I just went to the solutions and followed along, because on lessons down the line, it refers back to the first lessons, so you need to retain some knowledge to advance. You can keep \"some notes\" but programming as you go down that path is mostly research and knowing WHAT and how to look for and use that data, so don't struggle too much to retain everything. Either way, if you get something wrong, it won't work, and just the process of fixing it is gonna be a learning experience. \n",

So take your time, but if you want my opinion, go through the course a bit faster, even if skipping to the solution and following along. It's a bigger pitfall if you lose motivation early on. You can always circle back, you can always look for answers. I'd say no to using chatgpt, but your time is valuable, and there is even more to learn out there and projects to make that you need to memorize everything or to feel bad on falling behind or \"cheating\" at this point.

I've added a 12h email notification for what happened since the day before, and a warning in case her main excel file hasn't been saved in a while. I didn't thought of those, I asked her what she needed and that became the goals of the project.

I wrote/drew the input and the desired output and tried to write the relationship between them and come up with pseudo code and it definitely helped. I recommend using Spyder to run the code or Google colab but honestly I have been told the best idea is notepad. Once you write the code, paste it in notepad and then trouble shoot. If you are doing it alone and you are confident of the logic in your program, try to troubleshoot and you will find most of the errors are syntax errors, like missing a colon or indent. Once you fix these and your code still doesn't run, paste the code and the error message into chatgpt and ask for help to understand what went wrong. Whatever you do, nothing beats the pen and paper approach in the beginning.\n",

The reason it's so highly compensated is because the people who are good at it are just born that way and enjoy it. Sadly, for you there's a good chance you aren't. It's like wishing to be born with three arms and only getting two. Some things are just impossible.\n",

You may want to go ahead and try a strict language instead of Python and that may click better.

It’s Structured so you have a sense of direction but there’s also projects where you have to complete parts or the whole thing on your own which encourages you to find the solution and experiment. Also A lot of the projects also don’t cover corner cases and the final solution provided by the instructor is as simple as possible in order to allow you to implement extra features and get creative. \n",

When your wife has downloaded IDLE (Integrated DeveLopment Environment) from the official Python website http://python.org/download/ she can go to the Help menu option and access Python Docs which lists the methods or functions available in Python. She can also look at the Examples available under the Help Menu option. The Turtle module allows graphics to be drawn. The tkinter module allows interfaces to be developed. The list of all modules available in Python are listed in Python Docs under the Help Menu in the Module Index. The Python Standard Language Reference is available in Python Docs and Python Manuals and their authors are listed in Python Docs as recommended reading.\n",

After all objects are queue the master blocks waiting on the workers to populate the done queue. \n",

There is also a relatively large amount of per request overhead with object storage so parallelizing requests can save a lot of time.

      "A lot of online \"cheat sheets\" are really just websites with more concise information than other sites. In my mind a cheat sheet is constrained by the size of a physical piece of paper. The most challenging part of making a set of sheets like this isn't really choosing the information to include; the real challenge is fitting that information into all the little boxes, and using all of the space well.\n",

      "When I first made these, I developed them in Word and then saved them as pdf for distribution. It worked, but it left artifacts in the conversion process, and it was really difficult to update the sheets on a regular basis. The first version of these were popular enough (1.3M downloads!) that I redid the entire set using Indesign. People had requested printer-friendly versions for a while, so one of the goals of that iteration was making a black and white version of the set.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're all programmers, so I looked for a way to automate the conversion from color to black and white. It turns out Indesign (and most of the Adobe suite) ships with a scripting language called [ExtendScript](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/extendscript-overview.html), which is like a 2000s-era JavaScript. I wouldn't call it a fun language to work with, but I was able to write a script that does the full conversion. So now it's relatively easy to make minor updates and fixes between full revisions.\n",

I couldn't find a book that made no assumptions but spoke to you like an adult. So that's the book I wrote.\n",

      "I also didn't like the approach of dumping everything about the language into a book. We have extensive online reference documentation now, so you don't need a book or course to teach you everything; you need a course that's well curated. The guiding principle of Python Crash Course is: *What's the least you need to know in order to start working independently on your own projects?*  It has worked well for all kinds of people, and I've heard from many readers who have learned programming mid-career to either change jobs, or do their current work more effectively.\n",

But for personal projects it's really easy to work with once you get a little practice with the fundamentals of init, committing, and branching. And, on a personal project, you can always back up your entire directory if you're worried you'll mess something up. You shouldn't do that often, it misses the whole point of version control. But if you're going to try a reset or rebase command for the first time, you can back up the entire project first, including the .git/ dir, and try these commands out.\n",

But I also second Reoc86: Corey Schafer is the best teacher out there. One way I've found to deal with all the horrific, confusing dependency issues is to alias python for a specific version. I work almost exclusively on Mac/Linux, where, if I want to run python 3.9 (for example) and I don't want to reset my PATH to that version, I can just d (at the command line in Terminal): \"alias python=python3.9\" Don't include the quotes when you run that in Terminal. Then you can run any package (with rare exceptions) that was developed prior to the development of 3.9 itself. Note that when you close out the Terminal, you also kill the aliasing. You'll need to do the aliasing for each new Terminal session. Schaefer recommends creating virtual environments, which is a better way to deal with the dependencies issues, but it's a little more complicated to learn (it's not really, really hard; just a little more work). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk\n",

A lot of basic learning can be boiled down to \"what do I need in my daily life that a computer could make easier\" and go from there. And if you get stuck, that's fine, do some research, see if others got stuck where you got stuck. Maybe find a group of people online (reddit, discord, etc) and ask the question there to get feedback.

If you get stuck, you have Google, youtube, and many other sites to help. Its not inefficient, it will take a little bit longer because you're learning while doing, but it'll be a project done in your portfolio, and it'll be you learning how to do things.\n",

Account number to keep track of which account it is? And then withdrawing, all that is, is taking the total amount of money you have, and adding. Deposit is like withdraw, but subtraction. You can also check how much you have, and give that output to the user. And how do you do all of that? Well money is simple, just integers, withdraw and deposit can take a parameter of x, and add or subtract money from x and get a new amount of money. Checking is just printing the amount to the console or wherever you want to display it. And then emails, password, and account number would be strings really. And verifying you logged into the account with the right info is just comparing strings. The account number, would be changed on how many people you have in your system. Just break the project down into smaller pieces. \\n\n",
